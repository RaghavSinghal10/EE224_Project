# EE224_Project

This was the end-term project for the course EE 224: Digital Systems. <br>
We had to design a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit in **VHDL** with the following functionalites:
* Capable of performing signed addition, subtraction, NAND and XOR operations
* Uses a 16-bit Kogge Stone fast adder to perform the signed addition in a 17-bit 2's complement form
* Test the model using different test-vectors to cover all edge cases with a test-bench
