# EE224_Project

This was the end-term project for the course EE 224: Digital Systems. <br>
The major points that our project, **16-bit Arithmetic-Logic Unit** covered are as follows:
* Designed a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit in VHDL to perform signed addition, subtraction, NAND and XOR operations: using a 
  16-bit Kogge Stone fast adder to perform the signed addition in a 17-bit 2's complement form
* Implemented it on the Altera MAX3000A Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD) using Quartus and successfully 
  tested the model using different test-vectors to cover all edge cases with a test-bench

The "images" folder contains snapshots of the simulation and results. The code is contained in "GeneralALU.txt".
